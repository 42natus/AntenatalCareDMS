This is a file-based implementation of a Data Management System (DMS) for an Antenatal Care Hospital.

Its UI is console-based and from the console, users can navigate the system to:
  
  - enter data into a record stored in a directory created specifically for the DMS;
  
  - view the records of patients (specifically the Patient Information, Visit Records, Medical History and Transactions)
